# breast-cancer-analysis-ml
Hi,

  This is a machine learning model for analysis of breast cancer as per following attributes of the tumour-
    Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Marginal Adhesion,Single Epithelial Cell Size, Bare Nuclei,
    Bland Chromatin,Normal Nucleoli,Mitoses, Class(2 for benign, 4 for malignant).
    
  
  The analysis is based on winconsin dataset and an attempt has been made to build a classification model for classifying tumours
  into Benign and Malignant tumours, thus trying to make a tiny attempt to cotribute to the field of Breast Cancer Research.
  
  Thank You
